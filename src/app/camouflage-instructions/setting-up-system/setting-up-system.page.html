        ïƒ¼	When choosing a location for concealment of equipment, consider the following:
        The location of concealed equipment and ULCANS should not stand out as foreign object in surrounding area.
        The geographical characteristics of surrounding environment to help assimilate ULCANS (e.g. locating ULCANS Increment I under or near trees or hills).
        Do not locate equipment to be concealed and ULCANS on top of a ridge to avoid creating a silhouette on the skyline.
